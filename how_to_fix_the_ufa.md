# How To "Fix" The UFA

I am a big fan of the UFA and each year after football ends I look forward to the professional frisbee season starting up so I can scratch the itch of watching sports every weekend. In my mind, the UFA wants to be the NFL's little brother: the sport that people watch when football's not around. The field size is the same and the players have done exhibition games during NFL half times.

I recognize that not everyone wants the sport to be another NFL; the following suggestions are highly opinionated, and anyway there is club for the die-hard "spirit of the game" folks. I love ultimate and I want to see what the sport would look like if the bar for excellence in it were raised to that of the NFL or NBA. So I don't think the UFA is "broken", but these are the things I wish would change about it.

## 1. Less Teams
   
There are too many teams and it is lowering the quality of the product overall. Having less teams would consolidate the talented players and raise the stakes of each weekend's games. There is no way each individual streamed game is pulling in the numbers necessary to cover the server costs. As the market for the sport grows they should add in more teams but right now there just isn't the infrastructure, players, or viewers to support 20 something teams in the league. I'm not sure where the money is coming from to cover the travel of players and run the streaming platform but it can't be sustainable. I guess it's the sponsors? Also, are there even any frisbee players in Las Vegas?

## 2. Gambling

Like it or not, sports in America are now fueled by gambling. In the past the AUDL had a presence on DraftKings so I know the commisioner of the league is alright with people gambling on the sport. Allowing viewers to place bets on the games opens up huge markets and allows new viewers to interpret the sport in a way that's already familiar to them. I recognize that preventing the players from gaming the system would be difficult. Perhaps the spirit of the game could be worked in there somehow.

## 3. Multi-point swings

The very highest level of frisbee is ultimately boring: the two teams hold serve the entire time and the viewer might as well only tune in during the very last few minutes to see who wins. It is exciting to watch a team claw its way back into a game after being down several breaks but if the other team is talented they can just hold onto the ball (disc) and burn clock. There needs to be a shot-clock in place and if teams score within the clock they recieve two points. If a defensive team gets a block and scores immediately they are rewarded - something to this effect. This increases the excitement of every pull and adds in a new dimension for the coaches to make their mark on a game.

## 4. General technical improvements

This is related to my point about less teams, because if there were less teams the league might have more control over the quality of each technical team. There are games I tune into where the camera doesn't follow the disc. The app on my phone doesn't stream games properly. There are no replays for fouls. The announcer's audio isn't synced up or mixed properly half the time. The camera saturation isn't set correctly. These are all basic mistakes yet common occurences when I tune in to watch an off-brand game and it makes me question why I'm taking the time.
